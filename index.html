<h2>Castle Escape</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Rescue the box of kitties and get out of the castle!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should enjoy searching through the map and finding the interactive components.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The goal of the game is to collect the box of kitties and find the exit. Players can use left and right arrows to move and the up arrow to jump.
<br>Players that fall into lava or water will die. Players that hit boxes marked with an 'x' will break the boxes.
<br>Players who hit the portal will be randomly transported to either: above the water, above the breakable boxes, at the exit.
<br>Players can only exit upon collecting the kitties.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game was created to test out Phaser tilemaps and interactions between the player and various object groups/layers. The goal was to have multiple things able to happen, without one defined and obvious path.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There are multiple ways you can get to the end.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The character is this spaceman-like character who is trapped inside of a castle. He wants to escape the castle, but first he needs to find his box of kittens. The evildoer has trapped him in this dungeon and locked away the kittens. There is no larger story.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no larger story other than this character is trapped in a castle, looking to escape after finding his kitties.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
5 minutes at most
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
